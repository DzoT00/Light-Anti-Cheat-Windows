1. Drag the Light Anti-Cheat prefab into your Scene
2. Create a new Script and name it something like OnCheatDetected. In this
   class you want to add a Method called Detected. Now you can do whatever you want
   when a cheat was detected, for example kick the player out of the match.
3. Assign the method on the CheatDetectedEvent from the AntiCheatComponent script.
4. Build your game with Il2cpp.
5. Copy the Light Anti-Cheat.exe file into your build game folder.
6. Done!
